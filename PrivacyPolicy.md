## I. How we collect and use your personal information  
### A. Collection and use of your personal information for providing basic functions
In order to provide you with App-related services, we will collect and use the personal information necessary to provide the basic functions of the App. You are not legally obligated to provide the following personal information, but without this information, we may be unable to offer you the basic functions of the App.  
1. Registration and login of R2 account  
In order to help you successfully create a R2 account, you need to provide us with your phone number and set a password for your R2 account. When you log into your R2 account, we will collect your account credentials, including a) account name, password, phone number, and verification code for identity verification; b) login token to help you maintain your login session. Additionally, when you create or log into your R2 account, we will also collect the region and country code you select to assist in determining the data center to which your Device and mobile device are connected. Since the phone number is important information for logging into the App, this information will be stored on the mobile device running the App. If you wish to delete your R2 account information, you may choose to delete your R2 account through the method described in Chapter IV below. If you have deleted your R2 account and wish to further delete local cache, you will need to remove the App from your mobile device.  
2. Maintenance of R2 account information  
In order to help you manage and maintain your R2 account, you may choose to set your profile picture and nickname.  
Your profile picture will only be used for display on the profile page and in the member center. When you upload or change your profile picture, we will request permission to access your photo album and external storage, and collect the image information you upload or change. If you deny these permissions, you will not be able to set your profile picture, but it will not affect your use of other functions of our products and/or services.  
3. Device network connection and binding  
When the Device needs to be used while connected to the network, in order to support you in securely connecting and controlling the Device through the App, you need to bind your Device within the App. During this process, we will collect the following information: (1) your R2 account information; (2) your device information, including device model, SN code, and bluetooth MAC address; (3) time zone setting information for performing cloud-based scheduled tasks and enabling smart scenarios.  
4. Device information display  
In order to help you better understand the status of your Device, we display the device name you edit and the device status information on the App. For detailed information on the device data we collect, please refer to the privacy policy corresponding to each Device you have bound.  
5. Device firmware updates  
We may collect the firmware version information, device model, and binding status of the Device associated with your R2 account through the App, in order to provide you with device firmware upgrade functionality.  
6. Maintaining App stability and security  
During your use of the App, in order to maintain the stability and security of the App, we need to collect your App crash information and mobile device-related data, including your mobile device’s system version, language settings, mobile device model, and the model of the connected device.  
### B. Collection and use of your personal information for providing additional functions  
In order to provide you with more convenient and high-quality services, and to enhance your experience using the App, we may collect and use your personal information when providing the following additional services. If you choose not to provide the information required for these additional services, you can still use the basic functions of the App mentioned above, but you may not be able to enjoy these additional services that can offer you a better experience.  
1. Network Intercom  
When you use the network intercom feature, in order to enable mutual identification among users during intercom communication, we need to collect your R2 account. To ensure the proper functioning of the network intercom, with your authorization, we will use microphone permissions to collect your voice data. Please be assured that the voice data transmitted during network intercom communication will not be retained on our backend servers.  
2. Emergency SOS  
When you use the emergency SOS feature, with your authorization, we will use precise location permissions to obtain your current location information and send it to your designated emergency contacts. To notify your emergency contacts, we will collect the name and phone number of your emergency contacts as provided by you.  
3. Widget Function and Auto-Start  
When you use the App desktop widget, in order to ensure you receive and understand the status information of your device in a timely manner, the App will have a certain frequency of auto-start behavior, which is necessary to enable the widget functionality. If you do not use the App desktop widget, the App will not auto-start.  
In addition to the above scenarios of personal information collection, in accordance with applicable laws, we may process data that cannot be used to identify a specific individual and cannot be restored, through technical and other necessary measures, for statistical analysis, data mining, product improvement, and business decision-making. This includes the anonymized data used for algorithm model training in the intelligent customer service scenario mentioned above. RockRoad will determine the purpose and method of collecting, using, processing, transferring, or disclosing such data in accordance with applicable laws. If such data is combined with your other personal information, we will still treat it as personal information and protect it according to the rules outlined in this Privacy Policy.  
### C. Situations in which Mobile Device Permissions are Requested  
In order to provide you with specific service functions, we will, with your consent, request relevant permissions and collect your personal information (if applicable) when you trigger related functions. You can refuse or withdraw the authorization for these permissions at any time. However, doing so may prevent you from using the corresponding service functions, though it will not affect your use of other features of the App. The mobile device permissions that the App may request are as follows:  
- Location Information: Used for Emergency SOS, and helping the user quickly input the delivery address.  
- Camera Permission: Used for changing user avatars.  
- Album Permission: Used for changing user avatars.
